The navigation buttons on the men bar will take you to 'Job Search', 'Notifications', 'Saved Jobs', 'Profile' ,'Login'.
Clicking on 'JOBPLUS' will also take you to the homepage from any of these pages.

On a desktop or laptop, these options are displayed in the menu bar.

The page will reload if you make edits.
